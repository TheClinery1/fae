# Roadmap
Current planned features/todos before declaring the crate ready for
any kind of use:
- Adding a glfw-based Window implementation, as the resulting exes are
  much smaller than glutin's. Of course, as an alternative
- Designing a more pleasant API
- Writing documentation
- Writing examples

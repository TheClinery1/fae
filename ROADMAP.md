# Roadmap
Current planned features/todos before declaring the crate ready for
any kind of use:
- Adding parameter to set the pivot point to rotated drawing
- Instanced rendering (A big performance boost for modern OpenGL
  environments)
- Making specific vertex attribs optional in draw calls
- Debugging why it takes a while to render the first frame after
  window creation
- Fixing a font rendering issue
- Designing a more pleasant API
- Writing documentation
- Writing examples

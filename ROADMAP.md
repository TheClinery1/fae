# Roadmap
Current planned features/todos before declaring the crate ready for
any kind of use:
- Making specific vertex attribs optional in draw calls (if benchmarks
  show that it gives a noticeable performance boost)
- Debugging why it takes a while to render the first frame after
  window creation
- Designing a more pleasant API
- Writing documentation
- Writing examples

# fungui
This is a work-in-progress GUI crate for making easy-to-code
lightweight GUIs. Main features / ideas of the crate:
- [IMGUI](https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0001)-inspired design
- Lightweight (not a wrapper for another UI library, like GTK or Qt)
- No native controls (because of the above point) -> graphics are
  implemented using OpenGL

## Current status
The crate is still very much in development and the API is changing
all the time. Wouldn't recommend using this crate for anything
currently. However, there is one working example, `counter`.

## License
I wouldn't recommend using this crate at this time, but you're free to
do so under the terms of the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).

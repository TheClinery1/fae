# fungui
This is a work-in-progress GUI crate for making easy-to-code
lightweight GUIs. Main features / ideas of the crate:
- [IMGUI](https://caseymuratori.com/blog_0001)-inspired design
- Lightweight (not a wrapper for another UI library, like GTK or Qt)
- No native controls (because of the above point) -> graphics are
  implemented using OpenGL
